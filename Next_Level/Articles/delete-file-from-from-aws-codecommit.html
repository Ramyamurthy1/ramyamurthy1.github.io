                Deleting a file is not easy or straight forward job. It can cause a permanent data loss situation. AWS 
                provides extra checks to make sure you know what you are doing.
                

                The below code explains how to delete a file from AWS Code Commit repository.

                    <li> When the commits were merged to the branch</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="paragraph">
                To get the commit id run the below command,

                                  }
